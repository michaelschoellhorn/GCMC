# GCMC
Code to perform a grand canonical monte carlo simulation of a system of hard rods in 2D. This simulation was created as a university course assignment. Therefore it should be viewed not as a ready-to-use code but as a showcase of the methods and the physics involved. 

## Features
Monte Carlo Insertion and Deletion with physically motivated weights
Multiprocessing Capabilities for faster simulation execution
Heavy usage of numpy functionality for faster execution
